# Caffe
**Read before proceed for the installation!**
Installation of Caffe on Ubuntu 16.04, without GPU support with OpenCV 3 installed.

***Acknowledgment***

- *The purpose of this git is to **ease the installation***
- *Please help the **original [BVLC/cafee](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)** by **citing them** in your works*

## Motivation
Installing Caffe is pretty straight forward as mentioned in [BVLC/cafee](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).
However and somehow pretty painful and headache for me. So by gathering all the information from 
[Installing Caffe on Ubuntu 16.04](https://steemit.com/caffe/@aquib/installing-caffe-on-ubuntu-16-04), 
[This is a guide on how to install Caffe for Ubuntu 16.04 and above, without GPU support (No CUDA required)](https://gist.github.com/nikitametha/c54e1abecff7ab53896270509da80215) and [problem.. /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lopencv_imgcodecs #4942](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/4942), I am finally manage to install it succesfully! Yesszaa!

## Changes
1. Uncomment CPU_ONLY := 1 in Makefile.config
```
# CPU-only switch (uncomment to build without GPU support).
CPU_ONLY := 1
```

2. Uncomment OPENCV_VERSION := 3 as I am using OpenCV 3 in Makefile.config
```
# Whatever else you find you need goes here.
INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include  /usr/include/hdf5/serial 
LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
```

3. Comment opencv_imgcodecs in Makefile (not Makefile.config)
```
ifeq ($(USE_OPENCV), 1)
	LIBRARIES += opencv_core opencv_highgui opencv_imgproc

#	ifeq ($(OPENCV_VERSION), 3)
#		LIBRARIES += opencv_imgcodecs
#	endif

endif
```

## Run the installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/KhairulIzwan/caffe.git
$ cd caffe
$ ./installCaffe.sh
```
